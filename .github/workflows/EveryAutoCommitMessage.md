This build is generated for every commit. The mod browser in the game will
automatically download the mod from this release because it will always be
the latest release.

To install the mod (from both stable or development), do the following:

1. Download the JAR file, it should have the name "Cyber-IO-byLiplum.jar"
2. Move it to Mindustry's mods directory:
    - Linux: `$HOME/.local/share/Mindustry/mods/`
    - MacOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Mindustry/mods/`
    - Steam: `steam/steamapps/common/Mindustry/mods/`
    - Windows:`%AppData%/Mindustry/mods/`

Or you can search the mod's name "CyberIO" with the "Mod Browser" in game.
