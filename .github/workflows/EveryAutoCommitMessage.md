This build is generated for every commit and will be available on the global mod list in 5 hours later thanks to [*
Anuken/MindustryMods*](https://github.com/Anuken/MindustryMods). The mod browser in the game will automatically download
the mod from this release because it will always be the latest release.

## How to install current release

1. Download the JAR file, it should have the name *"CyberIO.jar"*
2. Move it to *Mindustry*'s mods directory:
    - **Linux**: `$HOME/.local/share/Mindustry/mods/`
    - **MacOS**: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Mindustry/mods/`
    - **Steam**: `steam/steamapps/common/Mindustry/mods/`
    - **Windows**:`%AppData%/Mindustry/mods/`

## How to install a stable one

Or you can search for the mod's name -- **"CyberIO"** by the **"Mod Browser"** in game, but it may be an at most
5-hour-antique one.
